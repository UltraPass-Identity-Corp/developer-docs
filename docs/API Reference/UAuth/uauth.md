# UAuth Integrations

UAuth is a secure and flexible authentication product that allows you to integrate with various systems and applications. UAuth supports two different types of integrations: OIDC and API.

- **OIDC** stands for OpenID Connect, which is a standard protocol for identity verification and authorization. OIDC integration enables you to use UAuth as an identity provider for any system or application that supports OIDC.
- **API** integration allows you to use UAuth's proprietary API for systems that do not have OIDC support but have the capability to call a RESTful web service. API integration requires more support and development, but provides a more flexible integration; allowing modern authentication flows to be consumed from legacy applications.

UAuth provides comprehensive technical documentation for both types of integrations, as well as sample code and tutorials to help you get started.
