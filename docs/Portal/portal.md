# UltraPass Portal

The UltraPass Portal allows for ease of administration of your Organization and Product configurations.

## Organizations

An <b>Organization</b> consists of a billing profile, domain, users, and product configurations. In order for users to be invited to join an Organization, they must have a valid email address in the corresponding domain.

Users have the ability to manage TrustLink Schemas and UAuth Flows on behalf of their organization. 

### API Keys

<b>API Keys</b> are generated per Organization and are displayed in the Portal. API Keys must be treated as highly confidential and should be rotated often. Each Organization is provided with a Primary and Secondary key that can be rotated independently.
