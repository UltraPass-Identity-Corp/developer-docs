## What is UltraPass? 

UltraPass is a platform that enables you to quickly deploy identity and credential solutions at scale, using the power of verifiable credentials. Verifiable credentials are digital representations of claims that can be cryptographically verified by any relying party.

UltraPass allows you to create, issue, verify, and exchange verifiable credentials across ecosystems, using open standards and protocols. UltraPass also provides you with tools and services to manage your identity and credential workflows, such as schemas, wallets, policies, metrics, and more.

With UltraPass, you can:
